# CMP-2020

**Update: Due to the covid-19 pandemic the project is taking place online in a dedicated channel of [The UK MathPhys Society](https://cam-mathphys.zulipchat.com) chat**.

The project has also [a dedicated channel](https://discord.com/channels/679792285910827018/714162621603119155) on the Xena project Discord server of Prof. Kevin Buzzard.

The [official webpage](https://leanprover.github.io/) of the theorem prover Lean (for download + documentation).  You should use Lean 3.

The [Lean Zulip chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/login/) (for questions, beginners welcome). You can start by skimming through the [new-members stream](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members).
Note that there is a private stream "cambridge" on the Lean Zulip chat for the students in Cambridge interested in Lean.

An [online tutorial](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/lean_together/source/leantogether.html) by Prof. Kevin Buzzard for beginners.

You don't need to know much about tactics in Lean to start working on the preliminary challenges (see the tex file `prelim_challenges` in the master branch), since they focus on definitions and statements, no proof required.

Please have a look at the [manifold](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/src/geometry/manifold) directory of the [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib) library, and the corresponding topic [manifolds](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/manifolds) on the Zulip chat.

Of course, also note that mathlib contains many repositories, especially `algebra`, `linear_algebra` and `topology` which will be useful.
