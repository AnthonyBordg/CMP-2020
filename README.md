The official webpage of the theorem prover Lean https://leanprover.github.io/ (for download + documentation).

The Zulip chat for Lean https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/login/ (for questions, beginners welcome). You can start by skimming through the `new-members` stream (https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members).

Please have a look at the `manifold` repository (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/src/geometry/manifold) of the `Mathlib` library (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib), and the corresponding topic `manifolds` on the Zulip chat (https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/manifolds).
