The official webpage of the theorem prover Lean https://leanprover.github.io/ (for download + documentation).  You should use Lean 3.

The Zulip chat for Lean https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/login/ (for questions, beginners welcome). You can start by skimming through the `new-members` stream (https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members).

An online tutorial by Prof. Kevin Buzzard for beginners (http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/lean_together/source/leantogether.html).

You don't need to know much about tactics in Lean to start working on the preliminary challenges, since they focus on definitions and statements, no proof required.

Please have a look at the `manifold` repository (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/src/geometry/manifold) of the `Mathlib` library (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib), and the corresponding topic `manifolds` on the Zulip chat (https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/manifolds).
Of course, also note that mathlib has in particular a library for algebra (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/src/algebra) and a library for topology (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/src/topology).
